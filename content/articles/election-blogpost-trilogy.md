Dutch version [here]({filename}/articles/verkiezingsblogposttrilogie.md)

In my election blogpost trilogy I analyze the climate policy of the Dutch prime ministers party (VVD) using the [En-ROADS climate simulator](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.36).

Part 1: [Climate policy of the Dutch prime minister's party (VVD)]({filename}/articles/climate-policy-of-the-dutch-prime-ministers-party-vvd.md)

Part 2: [Dutch climate policy and the importance of systems thinking]({filename}/articles/dutch-climate-policy-and-the-importance-of-systems-thinking.md)

Part 3: [Dutch climate policy - suggestions for improvement]({filename}/articles/dutch-climate-policy-suggestions-for-improvement.md)
